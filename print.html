<p>Legends of Zack is a fantasy world based on characters and locations from Casey Universe intended for D&amp;D, AI Dungeon, KoboldAI or alike. At the heart of the world is <a href="./essence.html">Essence</a>, a magical energy that can be used to create powerful spells.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="origins"><a class="header" href="#origins">Origins</a></h1>
<img src="imgs/og-legends.png" width="250" style="float:left;padding:5px">
<p>Legends of Zack can trace its roots all the way back to 2005. Known as Legends of Z, at the time, Zack (who was simply Z back then) received a mallet as a gift from a wizard in order to defeat monsters. The idea was created by an old DeviantART friend going by T-Up.</p>
<p>The concept was revisited a few times in the over the years but wasn't until a friend showed me AI Dungeon and I got into D&amp;D that the groundwork for Legends of Zack would eventually be made. It began when I wanted to use AI Dungeon's <a href="https://ai-dungeon.fandom.com/wiki/Default_Scenario#Fantasy">Wizard scenario</a> to create magic system with <a href="./essence.html">Essence</a> as the source. The way I went about refining that is a story in it of itself.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-game"><a class="header" href="#the-long-game">The Long Game</a></h2>
<img src="imgs/torneth-side.png" width="250" style="float:right;padding:5px;transform: scaleX(-1);">
<p>While creating the magic system, I wanted to keep the game endless because I had more fun trying to find the book than actually getting it, which there was always 50/50 chance of. After all, you begin in a ruin that is literally a dungeon. I was able to pull this off in early prototypes of the Essence magic system but it always took me away from the book's location.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> Got so crazy I managed to accidentally start a whole war between two Wizards and Rouges that would put Harry Potter to shame.</p>
<p>In order to tame the beast that I've unleashed, I realized I needed a proper antagonist. Like getting the book, there is nearly a 50/50 chance you'll run into another wizard searching for the book too. So I decided to base antagonist off of the idea that there was a wizard before you and came up with <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/view/41439402/">Torneth</a>. Not only did he come long before you but he unlocked a curse that forever has him chained to the book. Meaning, if you want to read it, you'll have to get through him.</p>
<h2 id="legends-reborn"><a class="header" href="#legends-reborn">Legends Reborn</a></h2>
<img src="imgs/zack.png" width="250" style="float:left;padding:5px">
<p>On the D&amp;D side of things, I had the idea of turning Zack into a D&amp;D character. He is literally my most developed character in part due to the fact that I'm also a fan of him too. Yes I'm a fan of my character. To keep it fit with D&amp;D's high fantasy setting, I dropped the Furry Blue DJ storyline and turned him bard with an acoustic character. In doing so, I realized I laid the groundwork to actually make Legends of Zack a reality.</p>
<p>It was when I was <a href="characters/torneth.html">redoing Torneth</a> that I decided to put the Essence, Torneth and Zack all under one roof and make Legends of Zack a reality.</p>
<hr />
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>This was due to the lack of <a href="https://wiki.aidungeon.io/wiki/World_Info">world info</a> keys that told the AI to stay within the ruin. Don't get me wrong, I still had fun.</p>
</div>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="essence"><a class="header" href="#essence">Essence</a></h1>
<p>Drawing on the subtle weave that permeates the cosmos, Essence is magic found creatures possess essence within themselves, making it the most widely available sources magic in the universe, but only a select few are able to tap into these energies, known as Mages. However, Essence is directly tied to stamina and requires consider amount of energy depending on how powerful the spell is. Losing too much essence can make a mage vulnerable to more harmful spells and potentially faint, if too much energy is lost. Luckily, essence is regenerate by simply sleeping, eating or using a health potion.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="runic-magic"><a class="header" href="#runic-magic">Runic Magic</a></h1>
<p>Runic magic allows a mages to create or channels spells using the Essence into symbols and sigils. Historically runes were written in ancient Norse alphabets but now they are written with Latin alphabet. It is one of the most common form of non-verbal magic in part due to the fact they can be written on and with anything. As runes are used to create spells or represent the spells themselves, they are typically written in gibberish. Using detect magic, a mage can determine what spell a rune represents.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-weave"><a class="header" href="#the-weave">The Weave</a></h1>
<p>The Weave is a hidden realm for trains with stations all over the world that interact back with the mortal world. Each train runs on its own using without needing to pull by any engine. Both the trains and tracks use magic, making really easy to maintain. All portals to the The Weave will pick the closet station. The Weave's tracks easily bridge back to the rest world.</p>
<h2 id="trivia"><a class="header" href="#trivia">Trivia</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>With the exception of The Infinity, The Weave was actually an idea created by AI Dungeon itself.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-infinity"><a class="header" href="#the-infinity">The Infinity</a></h1>
<p>The Infinity is your personal magic train that travels along the The Weave and varies realms where there are railroads. It is a 8 car double dcker sleeper train with a cafe car in the center. Though small on the outside, The Infinity is vast and complex train on the inside with small to large rooms fit for a king. The doors will only open for you, friends or other mages. If a mage chooses to operate the train, The Infinity has cab cars on either side. Each cab car have doors in the front middle, below the cab itself, that can be used to traverse through to another train.</p>
<h2 id="sunrise-express"><a class="header" href="#sunrise-express">Sunrise Express</a></h2>
<p>The Sunrise Express is the non-magic counterpart of The Infinity and features same formation and design. It is a daily double decker sleeper train that travels to and from Furtropolis. Unlike The Infinity, the Sunrise Express is not your personal train, requires a ticket to enter, and a driver to operate. Ironically, it was still used as a personal train in a war torn version of Furtropolis after the Central Tower came down.</p>
<h2 id="trivia-1"><a class="header" href="#trivia-1">Trivia</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The Infinity was named after Cartoon Network's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Train">Infinity Train</a> because it can travel indefinitely along The Weave. Ironically, it was created before The Weave.</li>
<li>The Infinity is mostly meant as a quick means of escape and to provide a moment of relaxation because pre-Legends adventures were particularly hectic.</li>
<li>The formation of both The Infinity and Sunrise Express are based off Japan's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/285_series">285 series</a> of trains.</li>
<li>The two trains are meant to be identical so The Infinity can easily stop at Furtropolis without raising eyebrows whenever magic is introduced.</li>

<p>A greedy Tabaxi, Torneth is a former upper-class wizard whom upon discovering the Manual of the Phoenix, unlocked a hidden curse that magically bonded him to the book and turned him into a black furred demon in the process. He now lives an immortal life within the ruins of an old tower.  Despite this, he still free to roam around, but can't go too far. Torneth will never admit the book's curse as it does give him great pain to think about the life he lost centuries ago. Ironically, he has made the Manual of the Phoenix and the ruins it resides his new home and will lie about location of the book when asked. He will secretly attempt to get mana from any mages that tries to get the book in order to gain more power. Despite his greedy behavior, he has mellowed out somewhat, revealing his true personality: he loves to collect fossils, read books, and his upper-class behavior has since resurfaced.</p>
<h2 id="usage"><a class="header" href="#usage">Usage</a></h2>
<h3 id="ai-dungeon"><a class="header" href="#ai-dungeon">AI Dungeon</a></h3>
<p>Torneth was designed around AI Dungeon's <a href="https://ai-dungeon.fandom.com/wiki/Default_Scenario#Fantasy">Wizard scenario</a> and is compatible with it. As described in his world entry above, he is intended to be the antagonist and is designed to keep the game truly endless.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/view/41439402/">early version</a> of the character, Torneth was trapped in the The Book of Essence. This was replaced with Manual of the Phoenix due to the <a href="characters/./../essence.html">Essence</a> functioning as Mana in Legends of Zack. As an unintended consequence, the AI would prioritize vampirism and necromancy because of that definition. This phenomenon was discovered long before Torneth's introduction and was simply an error on my part.</p>
<h3 id="dd"><a class="header" href="#dd">D&amp;D</a></h3>
<p>I'm not sure how well he would work in D&amp;D campaign due to the fact he was intended to keep the game truly endless.</p>

<p>Foxscular makes a mean stew, and he's a good cook. But who is he? And why does he keep showing up everywhere in the world? Whenever we're in need of food, there usually a bar or restaurant where he is ready to serve up the best food in the world.</p>

<ul>
<li>I deleted the original version of Torneth from Hero Forge and had to use Foxscular Chef as the new base when redoing the character because he already closely resembled him. I'll let your imagination run wild with that little fact.</li>
