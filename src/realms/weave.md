# The Weave

Ranging from double to quadruple tracks, The Weave is a isolated railway realm for autonomous trains that travel across tracks to stations all over the world. Each train on the The Weave is powered by magic provided from the rails, but a mage can take control if they need do. All portals to the The Weave will drop them off at the nearest station.

## Tracks

Harmless to creatures, magic from the tracks powers the autonomous trains and make them move. The Weave is primarily is a double-track railroad, one track in each direction. There are varies junctions in both directions that lead to sidings, yards and branch lines. In certain sections of The Weave, the tracks split from double to quadruple in order to handle increased traffic more during rush hour. Regardless of the number of tracks, there are signals in every direction.

## Background

With the exception of [The Infinity](./weave/infinity.md), the idea for The Weave actually thought up from the character created by AI Dungeon itself. I simply adapted and built upon it.
