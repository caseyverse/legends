# Kingdom of Larion

Built upon the bravery, cunning and craftsmanship of its past, the kingdom of Larion is now among the most fortunate kingdom in its corner of the world. Their industry, literacy and housing are among its current greatest strengths. Unfortunately they lack a little in trade and infrastructure. There are some opposing groups against the current leadership and this has been the case for a long time. However, the current greatest threat to the kingdom is imminent war, but the current leadership is working with the public to solve this issue. The furries of Larion are content. They wear minimal clothing, usually a tunic, loincloths, or robes and may go bottomless. They live rewarding lives and while income might be lacking, their alchemy helps relief most of their issues. Religion holds no real importance in their lives and, if anything, has made them more elegant.

## Background

Larion is the default kingdom in AI Dungeon's [fantasy sceneries](https://ai-dungeon.fandom.com/wiki/Default_Scenario#Fantasy). The world is not defined beyond it's name. The description itself was generated by Fantasy Name Generator which wind up including elements that could lead to the war, similar to what was experienced during [The Long Game](./../origins.md#the-long-game).
