# The Infinity

Owned by you, The Infinity is your personal express train that is constantly on the a move as it travels across The Weave. It is designed for your friends and mages that travels along the railroad. The Infinity is a multiple-unit train with seven sleep cars with one hybrid dining and lounge car in the center, each with a gangway connection connecting them all. The front and back of the train are hybrid sleeper and cab cars. The doors will only open for you, friends or other passengers on The Weave. Each car on the train has small indicator lights on the side of the vestibule that will tell if the train is moving or not, green and red, respectfully.

## Background

Named after Cartoon Network's Infinity Train, this train was created by me as a safe haven. It's formation and design is directly based off of JR's [285 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/285_series), used by Sunrise Izumo and Seto routes. While autonomous, the lights on the train are there for conductors.

<!-- ## Background

The Infinity was named after Cartoon Network's [Infinity Train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Train) because it can travel indefinitely along The Weave. Ironically, it was created before The Weave. It is mostly meant as a quick means of escape and to provide a moment of relaxation because pre-Legends adventures were particularly hectic. The formation of both The Infinity and Sunrise Express are based off Japan's [285 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/285_series) of trains. The two trains are meant to be identical so The Infinity can easily stop at Furtropolis without raising eyebrows whenever magic is introduced. -->
