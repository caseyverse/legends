## Description

Torneth is a Tabaxi was once a famously wealthy wizard rumored to have disappeared. Truth was he had turned him into a black furred demon inside a ruined tower but no one knows why and refuses to say why. Torneth wears a top-half of an ox skull as a hat, a shredded shirt and loincloth. Though centuries old, Torneth looks quite young as he hasn't physically aged since becoming a demon. Despite his greed, he has mellowed out somewhat, revealing his true personality: he loves to collect fossils, read books, his wealthy behavior has since resurfaced. Torneth will even treat furries like a wealthy furry he once was. Like everyone else, Torneth has heard about the legendary [Artemis](artemis.md) and is quite fearful of his power.

## Usage

### AI Dungeon

Torneth was designed around AI Dungeon's [Wizard scenario](https://ai-dungeon.fandom.com/wiki/Default_Scenario#Fantasy) and is compatible with it. As described in his world entry above, he is intended to be the antagonist and is designed to keep the game truly endless.

In an [early version](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/41439402/) of the character, Torneth was trapped in the The Book of Essence. This was replaced with Manual of the Phoenix due to the [Essence](./../essence.md) functioning as Mana in Legends of Zack. As an unintended consequence, the AI would prioritize vampirism and necromancy because of that definition. This phenomenon was discovered long before Torneth's introduction and was simply an error on my part.

### D&D

I'm not sure how well he would work in D&D campaign due to the fact he was intended to keep the game truly endless.
