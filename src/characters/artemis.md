## Description

Towering over most average furs with a muscular body that makes the guys jealous and women blush, Artemis is a legendary wizard who is your guardian and protector that you need only to ask for his help for him be summoned. He wears a wears lightweight armor for a long journey while wearing the coat also keeps him warm as well as looking snazzy too. Artemis is a powerful fox who has mastered every school of magic. Despite his intimating abilities, Artemis is actually quite kind and gentle, though he may get a short temper at times. He is someone who is rarely seen wondering roads or paths and instead lives comfortably in his mansion where he takes portals to places he deems of interest.

## Background

Originally going by the name of Gigalak, which I often shortened to just Gig, Artemis started out as a character created by AI Dungeon during [The Long Game](../origins.md#the-long-game). Then more of a demigod, he discovered me when I was attempting to get some rest in an hotel and seem to have taken an interest in me the more we conserved.

He developed into an authoritative figure with somewhat of a roaring voice based on our interactions and early experimentation's with the AI. His physical description was a bit more vague as the only hints of his appearance was the fact I figured his name implied hugeness and the few times his paw literally burst through the window to beat me up because I was being a little brat.

Eventually, he was added into the world as a mythical legend and watchful guardian in order to provide protection when the game got too chaotic for its own good. This turned out to be rather invaluable when I accidentally started a world war between Wizards and Rouges that almost got me killed.
