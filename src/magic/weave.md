# The Weave

The Weave is a hidden realm for trains with stations all over the world that interact back with the mortal world. Each train runs on its own using without needing to pull by any engine. Both the trains and tracks use magic, making really easy to maintain. All portals to the The Weave will pick the closet station. The Weave's tracks easily bridge back to the rest world.

## Trivia

- With the exception of The Infinity, The Weave was actually an idea created by AI Dungeon itself.
