# Runic Magic

Runic magic allows a mages to create or channels spells using the Essence into symbols and sigils. Historically runes were written in ancient Norse alphabets but now they are written with Latin alphabet. It is one of the most common form of non-verbal magic in part due to the fact they can be written on and with anything. As runes are used to create spells or represent the spells themselves, they are typically written in gibberish. Using detect magic, a mage can determine what spell a rune represents.
