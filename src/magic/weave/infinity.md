# The Infinity

The Infinity is your personal magic train that travels along the The Weave and varies realms where there are railroads. It is a 8 car double dcker sleeper train with a cafe car in the center. Though small on the outside, The Infinity is vast and complex train on the inside with small to large rooms fit for a king. The doors will only open for you, friends or other mages. If a mage chooses to operate the train, The Infinity has cab cars on either side. Each cab car have doors in the front middle, below the cab itself, that can be used to traverse through to another train.

## Sunrise Express

The Sunrise Express is the non-magic counterpart of The Infinity and features same formation and design. It is a daily double decker sleeper train that travels to and from Furtropolis. Unlike The Infinity, the Sunrise Express is not your personal train, requires a ticket to enter, and a driver to operate. Ironically, it was still used as a personal train in a war torn version of Furtropolis after the Central Tower came down.

## Trivia

- The Infinity was named after Cartoon Network's [Infinity Train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Train) because it can travel indefinitely along The Weave. Ironically, it was created before The Weave.
- The Infinity is mostly meant as a quick means of escape and to provide a moment of relaxation because pre-Legends adventures were particularly hectic.
- The formation of both The Infinity and Sunrise Express are based off Japan's [285 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/285_series) of trains.
- The two trains are meant to be identical so The Infinity can easily stop at Furtropolis without raising eyebrows whenever magic is introduced.
